## Synopsis

This is a hipchat bot built on top of wobot and hipchatter. It is silly but also acts as a two way interface for Atlassian Jira and other services that provide APIs.
@todo: add documentation from confluence

## Dependencies

Currently require modules are committed as I am using this to learn node.js. In time these will be in a package.json file.
